# Frontend Mentor challenge - FAQ Accordion card

<p>My version of profile card component for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam).</p>
<p>For this challenge I used plain HTML and SASS. Component is slightly responsive. This one was a bit difficult, mostly the illustration positioning.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was fun and I learned how to create accordion card!</p>
